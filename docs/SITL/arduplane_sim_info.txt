In aerfpilot for simple sim with mavproxy
Plug in Taranis
Check that Taranis is set to MvPrxyJSBSim
Make sure in manual mode
start apm planner2
then in ArduPlane dir do start_sim.sh
This will start mavproxy

// flightgear

for now see the doc mavproxy_setup_fg_joystick.txt in my fork of official ardupilot on "sitl-joystick" branch in docs

start flightgear using

/home/andy/cpp/projects/ardupilot/Tools/autotest/fg_plane_view.sh

start sitl in the terminal in the normal way

in mavproxy : module load joystick

/home/andy/cpp/projects/ardupilot/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -j4 -L KSFO
