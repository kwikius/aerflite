N.B only currently works on my fork of main ardupilot on "sitl-joystick" branch
Get FlightGear sim working with mavproxy sitl.

to build
Customised version of ardupilot to connect a joystick to sitl direct

checkout the branch "sitl-joystick"
N.B from current master, also need to update modules. 
Do git submodule init , git submodule update --recursive
in ardupilot dir do 
make sitl plane or 
but may need to messa bout with mavlink calss which have chaged
./waf configure --board sitl
./waf plane

Could use make but would need to add path to quan to includes.
This has been done for sitl in 

   ardupilot/Tools/ardupilotwaf/boards.py

   (see around line 200)


Switch on Taranis. Make sure the model MvPrxyJSBSim is selected
 then Plug in Taranis to usb port on PC

Open a terminal
cd /ardupilot/Tools/autotest

Since the joystick is connected to sitl direct
in fg_plan_view.sh add the option, 

 --prop:/input/joysticks/js[0]=0 \
which stops Flighgear using the joystick for input

 run fg_plane_view.sh

wait for FlightGear to settle down

Open another terminal

cd to ardupilot/ArduPlane

put jsbsim executable mavproxy and autotest in your path e.g using export
(I already installed mavproxy using pip install mavproxy)
do setup_sim.sh
or
e.g
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cpp/projects/jsbsim/src
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cpp/projects/ardupilot/Tools/autotest
export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH

run sim_vehicle.py -j4 -L KSFO

when console starts do 

 arm throttle

Taranis settings
(Raw values of number are +- 32767 for raw joystick or +- 1 for mixer_lang)

Throttle : low throttle is negative  , high throttle is positive

Rudder :To Go left is positive of zero, to go right is negative

Pitch : Pitch down is positive, pitch up is negative

Aileron : from pilots view Roll clockwise rel earth is positive, roll anti-clockwise is negative

channel 8 is Flight control
