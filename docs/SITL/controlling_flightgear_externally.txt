controlling Flightgear externally

Article could be renemed Arduilot SITL

In this case FlightGear is just used as a 3D viewer.

The SITL consists of the ArduPilot sitl executable and a flight simulator engine.

Sitl uses sockets

sends control outputs to FG ( e.g aileron, elevator, throttle, rudder)

sends imu and position data to FG ( See libraries/SITL_State.cpp )

See 
$FG_ROOT/Docs/README.IO

simple control to FlightGear

Protocols look to be in 
/usr/share/games/flightgear/Protocol
n.b that most Flightgear stuff is under /usr/share/games/flightgear/

n.b that FGShim (below) adds a custom Mavlink protocol,
but later versions appear to use the standard native-fdm protocol FDM ( for Flight Dynamics Model)
The structure names in :
/home/andy/cpp/projects/ardupilot/modules/mavlink/pymavlink/fgFDM.py
are identical to those in
https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=23129

Original FG data structure is discussed here
http://wiki.flightgear.org/Property_Tree/Sockets#FGNetFDM_.26_FGNetCtrl

is in FG/src/Network/net_fdm.hxx

 jsbsim dir in in /usr/local/share/jsbsim
