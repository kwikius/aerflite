Compass setup
11:51 May 07 2017
The compass setup is currently not optimal.

If you change compass orientation, then you need to manually rotate the compass offsets to follow.

Ideally the offsets would be in the compass plane then this wouldnt be necessary

Final Compass orientation should be relative to the heading of the vehicle.

simple case
Final Compass is orientated so that if  aircraft is pointing north
x is max y is 0, e,g North is in direction of x axis

TODO try reversing z in compass z should be +ve when straight n level as positive z is down.
See comments in COMPASS_ORIENT parameter in Compass.cpp

Try setting COMPASS_ORIENT param to NONE
look at why
